# APB-TO-SPI-PROTOCOL
 Designed and verified SPI protocol to enable full-duplex communication between master and slave  devices.   • Implemented master and slave modules, developed a Verilog testbench for functional verification.   • Verified timing parameters like CPOL and CPHA, and analyzed waveforms using Synopsys VCS and Questa  Sim.
